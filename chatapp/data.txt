Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of energy, heat, and their transformations. It primarily focuses on understanding how energy is transferred between systems and how it affects matter. The field is governed by four fundamental laws that dictate how energy interactions occur. The First Law of Thermodynamics, also known as the Law of Energy Conservation, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This principle ensures that in any process, the total energy of the universe remains constant. The Second Law of Thermodynamics introduces the concept of entropy, a measure of the system's disorder. It states that the entropy of an isolated system will tend to increase over time, meaning energy transformations are inherently inefficient and some energy is lost as waste heat.

The Third Law of Thermodynamics posits that as a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy approaches a constant minimum, essentially implying that perfect order is achievable only at this unattainable temperature. Lastly, the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics establishes the foundation for temperature measurement, stating that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This underpins the concept of temperature as a measure of thermal energy balance. Thermodynamics is widely applied in various fields, including engineering, chemistry, and environmental science, to analyze systems such as engines, refrigerators, and even biological processes, emphasizing its profound importance in both theoretical and practical aspects of science and technology
